# Architectural decisions

## HTML Decisions
To-do.

### Accesibility decisions
I'm a Colombian citizen that believes in inclusion, but I can't talk about inclusion if my own website is only designed for those who can talk English (Or another unique language); ideally my info should be written in as many languages as possible, but I only can read/write/speak Spanish (my native language), English and other languages (programming languages, but they don't count here :v). So I've decided implement [i18n library for VueJS](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/).

## Behaviour decisions (Vue, JS, Vuex, Integration with API's)
To-do.

## Style decisions
I'm following these structures:
Since I'm starting this project, I'm building a *Basic directory structure*, but in the future we can move on and build a *One step further* solution, everything is documented here in:
[How to structure your project a SASS project](http://thesassway.com/beginner/how-to-structure-a-sass-project)?

But if we get into a more complicated stuff, I can review [this](https://vanseodesign.com/css/sass-directory-structures/) for another purposes.

I'm trying to adopt in the project itself pure [BEM notation](http://getbem.com/).

Here is the [color palette](https://color.adobe.com/es/Harvest-color-theme-647427/).
